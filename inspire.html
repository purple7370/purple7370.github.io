<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>"<i></i>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</i>"</p>
<p>So why is a color my hero? Well, just look at it. Not only is it the embodiment of pure beauty, but it is also a symbol of royalty, luxury, and magic, all kinds of things that make our lives feel complete when we get ever so much as a sliver of it. It's a bold color, inspiring creativity and imagination, standing out as a unique beauty among nature - just like that of a true hero.</p>
