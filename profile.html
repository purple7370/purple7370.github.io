    <h2>Perhaps I should introduce myself.</h2>
    <p>Greetings. I am Murasaki, the omnipotent being of all that ever was and all that will ever be in the name of the color purple. Could you call me a deity? Could you call me a god? Perhaps, perhaps not. I wield no extraordinary power. I merely exist to frighten those who go against the inescapable beauty of this hue, and empower those who worship it. But now that you have met me, I can neither help nor hinder you. Off you go.</p>
